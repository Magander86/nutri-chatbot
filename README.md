# Chatbot integration with Claude AI by Anthropic

## Description
In this project I use React with Vite tools and Nodejs as a websocket server. If you want to test it yourself, just clone and do the
`npm install` command in the root and server folder to install the React and Node dependencies.

## Sources
I use socket.io to do the websocket server and client. The documentation may be found here:
https://socket.io/docs/v4/

The integration with the Anthropic AI was made by using their SDK for javascript/typescript. The steps to do it may be found here:
https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/getting-started

They give some credits for newcomers to test the API, thats nice.
Don't forget to save your API key in a .env file in the server folder

Have fun ðŸ˜‰!
